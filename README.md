## Hey, I‚Äôm Rodrigo

I am an astrophysicist. I work at the interface between black hole astrophysics, machine learning and high-performance computing. When I am not thinking about these issues, I am reading, writing and riding motorcycles. I am originally from the south of Brazil.

- üë• I lead a [black hole research group](https://blackholegroup.org) at University of Sao Paulo (USP), where I have been fortunate to mentor fantastic researchers and data/computational scientists.
- üìä I am currently excited about neural operators, transformers and applying causal inference to science. Always interested in new, challenging astrophysical problems and fun ML applications.
- üå† I taught several astronomy courses at USP, as a Professor.
- üåç I have lived, in no particular order, in Wyoming, Passo Fundo, Washington DC, Sao Paulo, Pennsylvania, Durham (UK), Porto Alegre and the Bay Area. 
- ü•è Fun fact: I once represented my home state in a disk throwing competition, and, ironically, ended up researching gas disks around black holes.
